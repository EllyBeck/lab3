    <p>A "storm quake" is a recently identified natural phenomenon where large storm waves trigger seismic events, resembling small earthquakes. The term "Cascadia" typically refers to the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ), a major fault line stretching from northern California to British Columbia. This region is known for producing powerful earthquakes, tsunamis and deadly storm-quakes.</p>
    <p>The most recent major earthquake in this zone occurred in 1700 and was estimated to be a magnitude 9. However it is feared that changes in the seafloor and pressure from seismic waves, compounded by large storms could produce the regionâ€™s next Cascadia in the next few years or even this year.
